## Notes to Skelly:
Hello Skelly,

I'll start putting up some info for you

### Cheatsheets
  * [MarkDown Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)
    * This is what we use to create Readme.md files (that is how this info section is created)

### Software I recommend:
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    * Used to push and pull code to this repository
  
  * [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
    * Amaizing text editor tool, likely not used as your primary coding environment (but still very usefull)
